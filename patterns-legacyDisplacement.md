# Legacy application modernization

Legacy application modernization is the process of updating or transforming existing applications to leverage modern technology and meet current business needs. 


## What you need to modernize successfully

- <b>Culture</b>: Empower staff to share ideas freely and solve problems together
- <b>Process</b>: Inspire innovation with processes that foster collaboration and community.
- <b>Technology</b>:  Develop an architecture foundation that offers scale, speed, and flexibility.

## Legacy application modernization steps

The pattern for modernizing a legacy application typically involves the following steps:

- <b>Assessment</b>: The first step is to assess the current state of the legacy application and identify its strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. This includes analyzing the application's architecture, codebase, data models, and other relevant components.

- <b>Planning</b>: Based on the assessment, a plan is developed to modernize the application. This plan typically includes identifying the target architecture, defining the migration strategy, estimating the costs and timelines, and identifying the risks and mitigation strategies.

- <b>Migration</b>: The next step is to migrate the application to the target architecture. This involves re-architecting the application, refactoring the codebase, and re-platforming the application to a modern infrastructure.

- <b>Validation</b>: Once the migration is complete, the application is thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets the desired functional and non-functional requirements. This includes testing for performance, security, reliability, and other relevant factors.

- <b>Deployment</b>: The final step is to deploy the modernized application into production. This involves configuring the application, setting up the necessary infrastructure, and validating that the application is working as expected.


## Legacy application modernization benefits

- <b>Agility</b>: Adapt efficiently and more readily to changing market conditions and customer demands.
- <b>Speed</b>: Deliver innovative new applications, services, and features in less time.
- <b>Cost</b>: Reduce operations, development, and infrastructure costs and technical debt. 
- <b>Security</b>: Improve IT and application security and protect sensitive data. 
- <b>Reliability</b>: Boost application resiliency and infrastructure reliability.
