# microkernel architecture

* it also refers as "plug-in architecture"
* users can add features or additionality in terms of plugins
* examples - many operating systems are developed based on this architecture
* examples - product or package based applications are developed in this architecture

## topology

* it consists of two types of architectural components
    - core systems
    - plug-in modules

* application code is split between core systems and plug-in modules, which gives
    - extensibility
    - flexibility
    - and isolations

* the core system can have
    - minimum functionality required to function - examples IDEs. The rest of the features can be given as plug-ins
    - some cases, it can also be a full features - examples chrome browsers. The extensions can be provided as plug-ins
