# Generative AI models

That can autonomously create or generate new content

- algorithm objective
  - what is your goal and what we want to accomplish?
- Data is the fuel to AI
  - fine tune the data to get advantage to narrow down a specific usecase
- AI models
  - this is the algorithm, the brain of the operation
  - defines how the model will learn patterns and relationship within the data
  - generative AI model
    - using the knowledge it can create new images, text, audio and more
  - foundational model
    - this is trained with  vast quantity of data at scale - example GPT
    - resulting in a model that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks
  - deep learnining
    - Transformers 
       - type of neural network that uses a technique called "self-attention" to identify what parts of an input, 
          sets of an article, are most essential, focusing on the relevant parts and ignoring the rest
    - Diffusion Models
      - in the field of image generation
      -  usually starting from random noise, into a target image, like a photograph, through a series of small, randomly determined steps. 
      -  Due to their ability to produce photorealistic images, diffusion models have potential applications in a wide range of domains. 
         For instance, they could be used to accurately identify or classify objects in images, restore images, 
         and generate rich media for use in many applications. 
    - Reinforcement Learning from Human feedback
      - uses signals from humans, such as upvotes or downvotes to improve the AI model
      - help to indentify offensive or negative comments
    - prompt engineering
      - critial interface between humans and machines, and by optimizing the prompts, the AI model can generate responses that are truly useful and revelant to the business
